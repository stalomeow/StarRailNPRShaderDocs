# StarRail NPR Shader Docs

Fan-made shaders for Unity URP attempting to replicate the shading of Honkai: Star Rail. The shaders are not 100% accurate because this project is not a reverse engineering - what I do is to replicate the in-game looks to the best of my ability. ![](../assets/stickers/firefly-1.png){.sr-sticker}
